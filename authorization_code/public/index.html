	  <h3>About Patty's Site</h3>
		<p>Welcome to my website, my name is Patryk Wisniewski and I'm a Polish-American student studying computer
		   science at CU Boulder. Additionally, I'm also taking a minor in both communion and
		   TAM(technology, media, and arts). My interest in computer science comes from my interest in game development
		   but after my first year of college, it has evolved. I’m interested in learning more about software
		   development, cybersecurity, and AI in the years to come. Outside of education, I love to mountain bike,
		   hike, camp, watch theater, and read books. This site is being hosted on my raspberry pi and is meant as a
		   platform to check out my current and previous projects. Please scroll down to see what I'm working on and
		   to check my projects out for yourself.</p>

		  <p>I am currently working on a dungeon crawler game for my enjoyment and experience. The game is constantly
			 being worked on and it is my hope to one day build this up into a full, fun, and extensive game that many
			 people could find enjoyment in. I am writing the game in C# using Unity 3D. The main goal for my game is
			 to create a system where the player creates a party of 4 characters and goes out into a dungeon with random
			 encounters, levels up, gains items, and challenges bosses. If you wish to check out the progress on my game
			 so far please download one of the links below. Please keep in mind that I'm still learning a lot about
			 Unity so be aware that there are a lot of bugs in the game. I try and push builds of my game to the server
			 whenever I feel that I have reached a notable checkpoint in my development, so if you want to see how the
			 game is progressing come back and check it out every once in a while.</p>

	    <p>This is a Spotify program that creates “safe” playlists based off the user saved music. The definition of
		   “safe” in the case of this program is songs that are popular enough to be considered mainstream. The program
		   works by grabbing all of a users saved songs from Spotify and then creating a playlist of “safe” music in
		   the users library.</p>
